        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p><h3>Working life</h3>
		   When I got my bachelors degree in financial planning I worked six years in the field of pensions and life insurance's.
		   
		   <h3>Volunteering </h3>
		   Mediation to help resolve conflicts in the neighbourhood. It was interesting to 
		   see how most conflicts have their basis in communication. I did this for two years. I am currently volunteering in my town as a web developer
		   for a local charity organisation in sustainability</p>
		   
		   <h3>Hobby life</h3>
		   I coach people with astma towards a healthy and energetic lifestyle. 
		   		   
		   <h3>Travelling life</h3>
		   My vacations are mostly a mixture of learning and relaxing vacations. I travel each year to China, India, or Thailand to learn more about qigong. This is
		   a powerful martial art to improve health.

        <h2>Why programming?</h2>
        <p>I wanted to have a new website. So I did a trial in programming. I enjoyed coding so continued learning different programming languages. Because
i was a complete laymen in the technical field it still feels magical to bring ideas to life through coding.
